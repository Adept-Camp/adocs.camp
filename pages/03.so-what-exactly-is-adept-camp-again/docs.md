title: 'So what exactly is adept camp again?'
---

It's like an unborn wild beast really.

Joking. 

No it's just a wrapper for the internet.

So anything you can do on the internet you can do with adept camp.

If you get stuck thats when it becomes useful.

Take this docs site for example.

Usually it goes a little something like this...

You get stuck. You google the issue. You go to the docs site. Try doing what they said to do. It doesn't work. Now you either give up. Take a course. Hire an expert. Join a forum. All of the above.

Adept Camp is all of the above.

Thats why we need a docs site.

It's also why we have docs for teammembers (created mostly by team members)

And docs for clients (created by both clients and team members)

- Adept Camp is a DAO
- Adept Camp is an agency
- Adept Camp is a community
- Adept Camp is a Platform
- Adept Camp is a PAAS
- Adept Camp is a proof of concept.
- Adept Camp is ...


## Adept Camp is a proof of concept.

For the idea that a university can be owned by its students. And be as good if not better in every way as the Uni's we have now.
A supermarket can be owned by its customers. And be as good if not better in every way as the supermarkets we have now. 

Perhaps if we can get that right we can try local government or more...

First we have to prove the concept. Develop a bunch of tools and systems. And use a bunch of existing tools and systems. Trying not to reinvent the wheel. 

We start with a digital agency owned by its clients & the agencies team (marketers, IT people, Programmers, etc).

And we start with a focus on online learning.
